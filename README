This project aims to create a router daemon for multihomed linux machines.

At home I've got two internet uplinks (DSL/PPPoE and Ethernet/l2tp). One is
fast, the other is slow and both go down from time to time. So there is a
need to test the links regulary and select a working one according to some
preset priorities, or maybe even do load balancing or routing specific kinds
of traffic through specified uplink. It also would be useful to control xl2tp
directly, because sometimes it just hangs and requires restart (I guess
that's a bug, but there will always be more bugs).

Right now project is in a initial development phase and only small parts are
implemented.

It's written in Haskell because of its advanced concurrency model and mostly
because I wanted to have some fun and learn something new )
